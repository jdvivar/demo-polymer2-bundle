## Install dependencies

```
$ npm i
```

## Start a web server to view your application

```
$ npm run start
```

## Building your application

```
$ npm run build
```

This will create builds of your application in the `build/` directory, optimized to be served in production. You can then serve the built versions by giving `polymer serve` a folder to serve from:

```
$ npx polymer serve build/default
```
